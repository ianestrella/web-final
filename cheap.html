                    <h3><li>2024 Nissan Versa</li></h3>

               <p>With its competition dwindling—the Kia Rio and Mitsubishi Mirage G4 will both soon be discontinued—the 2024 Nissan Versa is the last bastion of cheap transportation. It makes sense that the Nissan would be the last vehicle standing, as its handsome styling, fuel-efficient powertrain, and value-focused features make it stand out among pint-sized sedans—and earned it a place on our 2024 Editors' Choice list. A 122-hp four-cylinder toils away under the Versa’s stubby hood, and performance is predictably sleepy. But its pokiness pays off at the pump, with class-leading fuel-economy estimates designed to keep your fuel budget well under control. The cabin is far from miserable, with nice materials and room for four adults—so long as they’re friendly with one another. While the base S trim is likely too spartan for all but the most miserly buyer, the mid-range SV and top-spec SR offer plenty of creature comforts for not much more money, including available heated front seats, a wireless charging pad, and automatic climate control. It’s every bit the downsized Altima that its styling suggests.</p>

                    <h3><li>2024 Mitsubishi Mirage G4</li></h3>
                        <a target="-blank" href="https://www.caranddriver.com/mitsubishi/mirage-g4">The Car</a>
               <p>Cheap? Yes. Cheerful? Not so much. The 2024 Mitsubishi Mirage G4 is one of the cheapest sedans on the market, and the subcompact sedan feels every bit of its low, low price. Under the hood is a weakling of an engine: A 1.2-liter three-cylinder with just 78 horsepower that it shares with the hatchback Mirage (reviewed separately). Acceleration is as poky as you’d think, but it’s frugal at the gas pump. The G4’s cabin provides good head- and legroom, but it’s narrow and elbows may rub, so pick your passengers wisely. The rest of the interior is decked out with plenty of black plastic, which is common in this class of car. At least the Mirage comes with a competitive set of standard features, including Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, automatic climate control, cruise control, and automated emergency braking. Unfortunately, the 2024 Mirage G4 ultimately is less than the sum of its parts. It might seem like a good deal on paper, but in this case, you truly get what you pay for.</p>

                    <h3><li>2024 Kia Forte</li></h3>
                        <a target="-blank" href="https://www.caranddriver.com/kia/forte">The Car</a>
               <p>The Kia Forte is a sporty-looking compact sedan but don't be fooled by its sharp sheetmetal: its greatest asset isn't how much fun it is on the road but how easy it is on your bank account. A lethargic 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine is standard, as is front-drive. It's plenty competent for zipping around town, but if you're looking for a bit of driving fun consider the GT model. The GT puts a sharper edge on the car's already keen appearance and drops a turbocharged 1.6-liter four under the hood, along with either a dual-clutch automatic or a six-speed manual. The turbo four adds some punch, but the GT's chassis tuning doesn't deliver the more finely honed moves of sport-sedan competitors like the VW Jetta GLI or Honda Civic Si. What the Forte lineup does offer is value, with all sorts of standard features wrapped in four handsome trim levels at exceedingly low price points—a situation made all the more impressive by a powertrain warranty that's better than BMW's or Mercedes-Benz's.</p>
