                    <h3><li>2024 Toyota Prius</li></h3>

               <p>It's always been cool to avoid spending stacks of money on gas, but it hasn't always looked it. The redesigned Toyota Prius makes a meaningful effort to change that. The new Prius comes with front-wheel drive and 194 horsepower. All-wheel drive is available, which comes with a tiny horsepower bump to 196. The 220-hp Prius Prime is the plug-in-hybrid version, which we review separately. For the first time, the Prius is both stylish and reasonably fun to drive, all while achieving better fuel economy than before, with an EPA-estimated 56-mpg highway rating. It has a jump on its compact competitors, which are slowly falling in line behind the Prius by adding hybrid powertrains, a group that includes the Hyundai Elantra hybrid and Toyota's own Corolla hybrid—with a hybridized Honda Civic coming eventually. We can't believe we're saying it, but the Prius is a fun—and cool—choice, which helped secure it a 10Best Cars award for 2024 and a spot on our 2024 Editors Choice list.</p>

                    <h3><li>2024 Hyundai Elantra</li></h3>
                        <a target="-blank" href="https://www.caranddriver.com/hyundai/elantra">The Car</a>
               <p>Compact sedans such as the 2024 Elantra are widely viewed as basic transportation—great for first-time car buyers, fuel-efficient, and easy to park in tight spots—but the Hyundai also brings a ton of style and a whole lot of value. The sharp exterior design turns heads but the Elantra doesn't skimp on traditional compact-car traits. Its cabin is spacious for its size and an available hybrid powertrain boosts the Elantra's fuel-sipper cred. The base powertrain is a breathless 2.0-liter four-cylinder, but the N-Line model comes with a turbocharged 1.6-liter that offers a bit more zest. Even so, none of the Elantra models will raise its driver's pulse. Its handling is less entertaining than rivals such as the Honda Civic and the Mazda 3, both of which offer crisper steering and a more agile overall feel. For performance-oriented drivers, the full-on Elantra N model (reviewed separately) is far more satisfying than the regular Elantra, but it also costs a lot more.</p>

                    <h3><li>2024 Hyundai Sonata</li></h3>
                        <a target="-blank" href="https://www.caranddriver.com/hyundai/sonata">The Car</a>
               <p>The Hyundai Sonata adds some attitude to the family-sedan segment that we hope is loud enough to wake up the others. Its mid-cycle refresh comes in the form of updated front and rear bumpers, new headlights and taillights, as well as big changes for the inside. While the Sonata retains its current powertrains, consisting of a 191-hp 2.5-liter four-cylinder and an N Line model with a 290-hp turbo four, all-wheel drive joins the options list for cars with the non-turbo. The 192-hp Sonata Hybrid that puts up big numbers for fuel economy also sticks around. While the Sonata's road manners don't impress us as much as the Honda Accord's, its high style quotient and value-oriented packaging make it a great choice among family sedans</p>
