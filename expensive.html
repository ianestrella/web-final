                    <h3><li>Bugatti Chiron</li></h3>

               <p>Undeniably beautiful, and unapologetically hyper, Chiron is the third installment in modern-day Bugatti’s crusade against slowness. In base form, this tarmac-munching monster tops out at an impressive 261 mph. The Chiron SuperSport, however, may be the fastest production car ever built, having supposedly touched north of 300 mph in testing. Such a feat is only possible due to the 1500-hp quad-turbocharged 8.0-liter W-16 wedged between its rear axle and cockpit. For the lucky few with the appropriate means, a base Chiron starts at $3,300,000. Even a starting price that staggering didn't prevent all 500 Chiron to be spoken for.</p>

                    <h3><li>Ferrari SF90 Stradale</li></h3>
                        <a target="-blank" href="https://www.caranddriver.com/ferrari/sf90-stradale">The Car</a>
               <p>Ferrari has fully leaned into electrification with its SF90, creating the quickest car we’ve ever tested. Despite the manufacturer’s claim of a 2.5-second zero-to-60 time, we coaxed the hybrid supercar into beating that by half a second. Credit a twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V-8, three electric motors, and an all-wheel-drive drivetrain that combine to push 986 horsepower to the ground. Despite still being outrageously expensive, with 2022 prices expected to start at $507,000 and $558,000, the SF90 Stradale coupe and Spider are bargains considering their hypercar levels of performance.</p>

                    <h3><li>Lamborghini Aventador</li></h3>
                        <a target="-blank" href="https://www.caranddriver.com/lamborghini/aventador">The Car</a>
               <p>Entering what we expect to be its last production year, the now-mature Aventador moves with flashy confidence unique to V-12 Lamborghinis. Its engine, a 769-hp 6.5-liter V-12, is big, and the body’s corners are sharp. It comes in bright colors and, in roadster trim, is best driven with the top removed. While extremely fast, that isn’t the Aventador’s only calling card. It’s an emotional machine designed to arouse something inside of those lucky enough to see one—let alone be inside of one. For 2022 Lamborghini has released the Aventador Ultimae edition, a sportier ode to the now-11-year-old hypercar. Pricing comes in at $501,953 for the Ultimae coupe, $550,542 for the roadster.</p>
