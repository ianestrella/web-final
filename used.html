         <h2><p>cars in 2024</p></h2>
           <ul>
                    <h3><li>2024 Hyundai Elantra</li></h3>

               <p>Compact sedans such as the 2024 Elantra are widely viewed as basic transportation—great for first-time car buyers, fuel-efficient, and easy to park in tight spots—but the Hyundai also brings a ton of style and a whole lot of value. The sharp exterior design turns heads but the Elantra doesn't skimp on traditional compact-car traits. Its cabin is spacious for its size and an available hybrid powertrain boosts the Elantra's fuel-sipper cred. The base powertrain is a breathless 2.0-liter four-cylinder, but the N-Line model comes with a turbocharged 1.6-liter that offers a bit more zest. Even so, none of the Elantra models will raise its driver's pulse. Its handling is less entertaining than rivals such as the Honda Civic and the Mazda 3, both of which offer crisper steering and a more agile overall feel. For performance-oriented drivers, the full-on Elantra N model (reviewed separately) is far more satisfying than the regular Elantra, but it also costs a lot more.</p>

                    <h3><li>2024 Kia Soul</li></h3>

               <p>Forget the hamsters—the 2024 Kia Soul is an attractive and distinctive option among today's crop of subcompact SUVs. Its boxy styling is extroverted and its interior offers whimsical touches, but the Soul oozes practicality thanks to a spacious cabin that's roomier than you'd expect given the car's small footprint. The Soul also offers an impressive amount of features for the money given that it's less expensive than many rivals including the Chevrolet Trailblazer, the Jeep Renegade, and the Kia Seltos. There's only one powertrain on offer—a 147-hp four-cylinder engine with a continuously variable automatic transmission and front-wheel drive—but the Soul is still good to drive thanks to its comfortable ride and refined demeanor.</p>

                    <h3><li>2024 Toyota Camry</li></h3>
                        <a target="-blank" href="https://www.caranddriver.com/toyota/camry-2024">The Car</a>
               <p>The Toyota Camry has done its job so well for so long that it isn’t merely a sedan, it’s an institution. Yes, it has lost sales ground in a market obsessed with SUVs and pickups, but for more than 20 years in the U.S., the Camry has been the best-selling sedan. The Camry has kept six-cylinder powertrains on the menu while its closest competition, the Honda Accord and the Hyundai Sonata, have gone to inline-fours only. That means the Toyota entices with a 301-hp V-6 at one end of the lineup and a hybrid four-cylinder trim delivering exceptional fuel economy at the other. What’s more, the current generation of the roomy five-seater has added stylish lines to the model’s well-earned reputation for reliability, especially when equipped with the Nightshade package's cool bronze wheels. And while the TRD model is the sportiest Camry ever, none of the changes made under the Toyota Racing Development banner have altered its core personality. In other words, it's still a Camry.</p>
