          <h3><li>top rated car overall is the 2024 Kia EV9</li></h3>

               <p>Going all-electric isn't just for sedans, pickups, and small SUVs anymore. The three-row EV9 SUV, which is about the same size as the current gas-only Telluride, shares its platform with the upcoming Hyundai Ioniq 7. The EV9 comes in rear- or all-wheel drive, with the latter featuring a 379-hp dual-motor powertrain. Both the all-wheel-drive and rear-drive Long Range models have a 99.8-kWh battery the EPA estimates delivers 304 miles of range with the single-motor setup. The standard rear-wheel-drive EV9 has a 76.1-kWh battery that gets an EPA-estimated 230 miles of range. Its big size comes with a big towing capacity of 5000 pounds—the same max capacity as the gas-powered Telluride. The EV9's usable third row of seats should appeal to growing families. Not only is it among the few three-row EVs on the market with a sub-$60k starting price, but it's also an especially good-driving EV of this size and an easy choice for our 2024 10Best Trucks and SUVs and 2024 Editors' Choice lists.</p>

          <h3><li>top rated car is the 2024 Toyota Prius</li></h3>

               <p>It's always been cool to avoid spending stacks of money on gas, but it hasn't always looked it. The redesigned Toyota Prius makes a meaningful effort to change that. The new Prius comes with front-wheel drive and 194 horsepower. All-wheel drive is available, which comes with a tiny horsepower bump to 196. The 220-hp Prius Prime is the plug-in-hybrid version, which we review separately. For the first time, the Prius is both stylish and reasonably fun to drive, all while achieving better fuel economy than before, with an EPA-estimated 56-mpg highway rating. It has a jump on its compact competitors, which are slowly falling in line behind the Prius by adding hybrid powertrains, a group that includes the Hyundai Elantra hybrid and Toyota's own Corolla hybrid—with a hybridized Honda Civic coming eventually. We can't believe we're saying it, but the Prius is a fun—and cool—choice, which helped secure it a 10Best Cars award for 2024 and a spot on our 2024 Editors Choice list.</p>

          <h3><li>top rated SUV is the 2024 Kia Sportage Hybrid</li></h3>
                        <a target="-blank" href="https://www.caranddriver.com/kia/sportage-hybrid">The Car</a>
               <p>Although it doesn't look it, the 2024 Kia Sportage Hybrid is a fairly ordinary compact crossover—it just hides its regularity behind a veneer of futuristic styling. Starting with the nonhybrid Sportage (reviewed separately) as its basis, the hybrid model adds either a turbocharged 1.6-liter hybrid powertrain that makes 226 horsepower, or a 261-hp plug-in-hybrid version that uses the same turbo engine. Both variants offer more power and quicker acceleration than the nonhybrid model, but neither deliver fuel economy that's particularly notable. The plug-in does provide up to 34 miles of electric driving per charge, though. The rest of the Sportage Hybrid's package is rather conventional, but that's not a bad thing. Its cabin is spacious and practical, it rides smoothly over bumpy roads, and it offers a high-value features list for the price. Its on-road demeanor is forgettable though, and rivals such as the Honda CR-V and the Mazda CX-5 both offer more engaging handling along with similarly practical packages.</p>

          <h3><li>top rated truck is the 2024 Chevrolet Colorado</li></h3>
                        <a target="-blank" href="https://www.caranddriver.com/chevrolet/colorado">The Car</a>
               <p>The pickup truck is as American as apple pie and there are few sweeter than the mid-size Chevrolet Colorado—a 2024 Editors' Choice award winner. Built for driving to work as reliably as it can drive through mud, the Colorado's chassis and offering of equipment support even the bravest off-road shenanigans. All Colorados are powered exclusively by a turbocharged 2.7-liter inline-four engine and an eight-speed automatic. While WT and LT base models get a 237-hp version of that powertrain, other trims—including the off-road-focused ZR2—gets 310 ponies. Every Colorado is four-door cab with a five-foot bed, and it can be optioned with either rear- or four-wheel drive depending on the trim level. With up to 7700 pounds of maximum towing capacity, the Colorado can haul campers, boats, and snow machines with ease.</p>
