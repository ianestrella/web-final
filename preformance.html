               <p>We've been singing the praises of the C8-generation Chevrolet Corvette since it launched because it brings mid-engine supercar performance to the affordable end of the sports-car spectrum. It costs half as much as more exotic rivals, but in no way are you getting only half the thrills. A naturally aspirated V-8 engine thunders just behind your skull, providing the auditory chills of an exotic sports car. The Vette's handling is razor-sharp and endlessly rewarding on a twisty back road. Track days are a joy, with confidence-raising handling and massive amounts of power on tap that make blasting out of corners a hoot. When it comes to commuting and road-tripping, the Corvette transforms into a comfortable cruiser with a near-luxury cabin, an agreeable ride, and a surprising amount of cargo capacity. Its dual-purpose personality has earned it 10Best and Editor's Choice awards again for 2024. Both a coupe and a convertible model are offered, but even the coupe comes with a lift-off targa top so you always have the option of basking in the sun and feeling the wind in your locks.</p>

                    <h3><li>2024 Porsche 718 Cayman</li></h3>
                        <a target="-blank" href="https://www.caranddriver.com/porsche/718-cayman">The Car</a>
               <p>The 2024 718 Cayman is a delightfully anachronistic sports car, offering modern conveniences such as touchscreen infotainment and Apple CarPlay while retaining the visceral, analog experience of a vintage Porsche. Its brilliant steering and surgically precise handling are the current benchmarks among sports cars and sporting automobiles of all kinds and helped it secure another 10Best and Editors' Choice win for 2024. Placing the engine amidships gives the Cayman—and its convertible twin, the 718 Boxster—a balance that front-engine rivals such as the Jaguar F-Type or the Toyota Supra can't match. While the base turbocharged four-cylinder sounds thrummy, power is generous, and in S models a larger-displacement four adds even more. The optional 4.0-liter flat-six in the GTS, GT4, and GT4 RS adds dulcet tones to the mix and boasts up to 493 horsepower. A six-speed manual transmission is standard (and would always be our choice), but a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic is available and operates with well-honed slickness. The cabin is snug and light on storage solutions, but otherwise, the 718 Cayman has proven over a long-term test that it's a surprisingly easy car to live with—all the better for justifying one as a daily driver.</p>

                    <h3><li>2024 Porsche 718 Boxster</li></h3>
                        <a target="-blank" href="https://www.caranddriver.com/porsche/718-boxster">The Car</a>
               <p>Originally conceived as the amuse-bouche of the lineup, the Porsche 718 Boxster—and its coupe twin, the 718 Cayman—has carved out a niche as a mid-engined performer worthy of sharing showroom space with the beloved 911. Even with the base turbo four-cylinder, the Boxster is a sports-car masterpiece, with crisp handling and a superbly balanced chassis. Drop the top to hear the exhaust note, and drink in the sun while you carve up switchbacks like you're serving them for dinner. While the Boxster is also happy loping along the interstate or running errands, it's not the most practical thing on four wheels; its usefulness takes a few hits thanks to small cargo areas and limited interior space. Even with those compromises, we can't help but be charmed by Porsche's smallest sports car, and it remains a favorite among our staff, winning yet another 10Best award for 2024 as well as a 2024 Editors' Choice award.</p>
